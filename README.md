# PowerRL
**PowerRL** is a research-focused analytical tool designed to **measure**, **monitor**, and **compare** the **energy consumption** of machine learning models trained with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** against those trained without it. 

As the scale and complexity of AI models continue to grow, so does their **environmental footprint**—particularly the **power consumed** during training and inference. **PowerRL** contributes to the **Green AI** movement by providing a visual and programmatic framework to evaluate not just model performance, but also the **energy cost** associated with achieving it.


##  Key Features

- Track live energy consumption during model training.
- Analyze energy usage across RL and non-RL models.
- Visualize consumption trends over time.

## Running PowerRL Locally

###  Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PowerRL.git
cd PowerRL
```

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is a lightweight React application to visualize energy consumption trends and metrics.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Once the server is running, check your terminal for the link generated by:

```bash
npm start
```

Open that link in your browser to access the PowerRL frontend interface.

You’ll be able to visualize tracked energy metrics as they are received from the backend.

### Code Summarizer

For detailed instructions on setting up and using the Code Summarizer, please refer to the README file inside the [code_summarizer](./code_summarizer) folder.

###  Backend Setup

The backend module is responsible for monitoring energy consumption and generating real-time metrics that are sent to the frontend.

### Step 1: Install the module

```bash
cd backend
pip install --editable ./
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Add energy tracking to your training script

```python
from carbontracker.tracker import CarbonTracker  

tracker =   CarbonTracker(epochs=max_epochs)

for epoch in range(max_epochs):
    tracker.epoch_start()

    # Your model training code here.

    tracker.epoch_end()

# Optional: Ensure data is finalized in case of early termination
tracker.stop()
```

When you run your training script, a local backend server URL will be printed. Paste that URL into the frontend interface to enable real-time tracking.
